    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_android_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE_ANDROID&r=C9:E9:57:48:74:22:C6:D6:0A:72:58:D0:F3:5C:17:EA:6B:56:3B:F0%3Bcom.example.smy.maps

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using this line:
    C9:E9:57:48:74:22:C6:D6:0A:72:58:D0:F3:5C:17:EA:6B:56:3B:F0;com.example.smy.maps

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.

    <string name="google_maps_key" templateMergeStrategy="preserve" translatable="false">oops where is my key ~~</string>
